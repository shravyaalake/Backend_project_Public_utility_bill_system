## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- You have npm (Node Package Manager) installed. It usually comes with Node.js.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/public-utility-bill-system.git
   
2. **Install the required Node.js modules:**

   Run the following command to install the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   npm init
   npm install express csv-parser csv-writer body-parser dotenv
3. **Create a `.env` file** (if necessary):

   If your application requires environment variables (like database configurations, API keys, etc.), create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add the necessary variables. For example:

   ```plaintext
   PORT=3001
4. **Run the application:**

   Start the server using the following command:

   ```bash
   node server.js
## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while setting up or running, consider the following troubleshooting tips:

- **Server Not Starting**: Ensure that you have installed all the required dependencies. Run `npm install` to install any missing packages.
- **Port Already in Use**: If you receive an error indicating that the port is already in use, you can either stop the process using that port or change the port number in your `.env` file.
- **API Errors**: If you encounter errors when making API requests, check the request format and ensure that you are sending the correct headers and body as specified in the API documentation.
